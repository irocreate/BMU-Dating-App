Keep a change log to describe all the changes made to program source files. The purpose of this is so that people investigating
bugs in the future will know about the changes that might have introduced the bug. Often a new bug can be found by looking at
what was recently changed. More importantly, change logs can help you eliminate conceptual inconsistencies between different
parts of a program, by giving you a history of how the conflicting concepts arose and who they came from.
